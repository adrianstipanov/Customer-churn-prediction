## [Customer churn prediction using survival analysis](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Customer-churn-prediction/blob/master/Predicting%20customer%20churn%20using%20survival%20analysis.ipynb)

Traditionaly, survival analysis was concerned with studying the time between entry to a study and a subsequent event. Originally, the analysis was concerned with time from treatment until death for patients in a study. More generally now, we can use survival analysis if we are interested in the time until some event happens.

For our purpose, the importance of such an analysis comes form the fact that, in general, it is more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones, therefore being able to predict the customers who are more likely to churn can help us allocate marketing costs to these customers which will increase the customer lifetime value

**Tools used:** Python, Lifelines, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Coxâ€™s proportional-hazards model
